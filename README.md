# scoop-nirsoft

A [Scoop](http://scoop.sh) bucket of useful [NirSoft](https://www.nirsoft.net/) utilities.

To make it easy to install apps from this bucket, run:

    > scoop bucket add nirsoft

## Why does this exist?

For an app to be acceptable for the main bucket, it should be:

* open source
* a command-line program
* the latest stable version of the program
* reasonably well-known and widely used

The "extras" bucket has more relaxed requirements, so it's a good place to put anything that doesn't quite fit in the main bucket.

The "nirsoft" bucket is specifically for the many (hundreds) of utilities found on the NirSoft website.
